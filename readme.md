# Github Instructions

## Pre-Requisites

## 1st Time Set-Up

Steps: 
1. Open your `Visual Studio Code` Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
2. When the `IDE` opens, click on it, and type the following to open a `terminal` window. 
```javascript
~ + control
```
3. In the `terminal` window, you want to navigate to the `Desktop` of your computer. The computer will be referred to as `local` machine. 
```javascript
cd ~/Desktop
```
4. Verify you are on the `Desktop` with the `present working directory` command. Type the following: 
```javascipt
pwd 
```

> NOTE: The `terminal` window will present somthing like `/Users/gabrielrodriguez/Desktop`. You can see `Desktop`. All the preceding words are what is referred to as a `path`. A `path` is a sequence of folders steming from the `root` folder. (We'll learn more about this later.)

5. In this step you will create a `directory` (aka folder) on your `local` that will house the code contents of our `Github` `Repository` (more on how we do this later). Type the following: 
```
mkdir webdev
```
