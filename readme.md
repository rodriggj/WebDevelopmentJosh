### Files Created
- variable_excer.js
- variable_excer_ans.js

### Directions 
- Look at `variable_excer.js` file. 
- I gave you three problems in increasing difficulty. Give them a try. 
- __DO NOT LOOK__ at `variable_excer_ans.js` file till you get stuck. 
- In there I provided a solution ... not the only way to do it, but may help if you get stuck. Try to google for help. The only thing I added here is the use of a function called `toUppercase()` which you might not have seen. Everything else you know how to do. Just think the the problem.
