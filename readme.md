### Questions
- [ ] How do you pull up the `html` in a browser 

    2 Ways to do it: 
    Option 1: 
        Steps
        1. Go to `Finder` and nav to the Desktop to find the folder `WebDevelopmentJosh`
        2. Right-click on the file and select `Open with...` -> `Google Chrome`
        3. The `.html` file will render in the Google Chrome browser

    Option 2: 
        Steps: 
        1. In the `IDE`, right-click on the file that you want to see in the browser (e.g. `index.html`)
        2. Select `Open with Live Server`

- [ ] Hey don't know how to split the screen like Colt does in the video? 
    Steps: 
    1. Use 1 of the 2 options in the previous step to get a `.html` file to render to the browser
    2. Click `option + command + J` on the keyboard and it will split the screen to show the `.html` file and the `google chrome tools` view

- [ ] What are all these back-ticks? 
    The `back-ticks` are an example of another coding syntax callled `Markdown`. Checkout this link [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). `Markdown` only works in `Github` on the `Issues` screens. Or in a file on your IDE with the extension `.md` (which means __Mark Down__). 

    It was developed so developers could `mark-up` the text on a file, without having to use `html tags` like `<p></p>` or `<h1></h1>`. So its a shortcut.
