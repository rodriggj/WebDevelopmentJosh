### Files Created
- die_roll.html
- die_roll.js
- die_roll.css
- isEven.js

### Questions
I creaed 3 files. See above. Don't mind about the `html` and `css` files right now. I created them because I'm sure in the next lesson you're going to be asked to link the javascript file to the html file and display the results of die1, die2, & roll. But for your immediate excercise. Look at `die_roll.js`. 

This should be your answer.
