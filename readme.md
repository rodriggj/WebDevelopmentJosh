### Questions
[] If something is constant can it be changed in an array by push, pop, shift, unshift? Get the difference between [let] and [const] but still too new to find out when they make a big difference or just can't be changed quickly.

[] I keep on looking over this and I feel like I am missing something huge though.  I don't know how it will display, if at all, or whether I have too many variables. Or whether I even did what I was asked.
