/* Varialbes are used ALL them time in code. 

Why do you use a VARIABLE? 
Variables are used to temporarily "store" something in Memory. 

When do you use a VARIABLE? 
Before you use a Variable you need to ask yourself a few things: 
1. Will the variable change in value? 
Example if I create a variable called "isSelected" you have to ask, will it changes from true to false? If use a variable called "color" 
can it be green, then red, then purple or will it always be "green"?

- IF THE VARIABLE will change use the keyword "let"
- IF THE VARIABLE is always the same or only changes to handle an exception, use the keyword "const"

// Problem 1 -- EASY
// #######################################

/* 
You are writing an application that is a "Shopping To Do list". 
Create a variable for the 
   1. title of the list, 
   2. creator of the list, 
   3. 3 list items 
   4. Log the Shopping list to the console with the title in All CAPs. (look in MDN for a function called toUpperCase). 
   5. Log the list items in a single line separated by a ", "
   6. Log the creator
Think through what variables should stay static, which change if its Always a Shopping List, and its always created by the same person?

Example: 
MY SHOPPING LIST
Get tomatoes, Get potatoes, Get Milk

// Problem 2 -- A Litte Harder
// #######################################

/* 
Refactor the code from Problem 1. 
1. Keep the title, and creator variables
2. Write a function that takes a list item as a parameter and displays the item
3. Console log all items on thier own individual lines

Example: 
MY SHOPPING LIST
Get Tomatoes
Get Potatos
Get Milk

// Problem 3 -- Hard
// #######################################

/*
Refactor the code from Problem 2. 
1. Keep the title, and creator variables
2. Create a new Array variable called "items"
3. Populate the Array with 3 list items
4. Write a function that displays each index value of the array separated by commas


Example: 
MY SHOPPING LIST
Get Tomatoes, Get Potatos, Get Milk
